<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective date: January 19, 2015</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Lookagram ("Lookagram," "we," "us" or "our"). Lookagram provides a fast, beautiful and fun way for you to share media through our content-sharing platform. Just snap a photo, choose a filter to transform the look and feel, add comments (if you like) and share!</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our mobile services, web site, and any software provided on or in connection with Lookagram services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>"), and your choices about the collection and use of your information.</p>


<p>By using our Service you understand and agree that we are providing a platform for you to post content, including photos, comments and other materials ("User Content"), to the Service and to share User Content publicly. This means that other Users may search for, see, use, or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (which can be found at <a href="#">http://Lookagram.com/terms</a>).</p>


<p>Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("<strong>Users</strong>").</p>

<li><a href="#">Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for a Lookagram account.</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Lookagram.</a></li>
<li><a href="#">User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Communications between you and Lookagram. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Finding your friends on Lookagram:</h2>
<ul class="lnk">

<li><a href="#">If you choose to find your friends through (i) your device's contacts list, then Lookagram will access your contacts list to determine whether or not someone associated with your contact is using Lookagram.</a></li>
<li><a href="#">If you choose to find your friends through a (ii) third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to us will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</a></li>
<li><a href="#">If you choose to find your friends (iii) through a search of names or usernames on Lookagram then simply type a name to search and we will perform a search on our Service.</a></li>

</ul>

<ul class="lnk">
<li><a href="#">We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving the Service.
