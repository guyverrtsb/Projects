<h1>The Team</h1>
<h2>Daniel Gale (CEO, Founder)</h2>
<p><strong>Daniel Gale</strong> (@DanGale) is the CEO and co-founder of Lookagram, a community of more than 1 million who capture and share the world's moments on the service. He is responsible for the company's overall vision and strategy as well as day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>Since the beginning, Dan has focused on simplicity and inspiring creativity through solving problems with thoughtful product design. As a result, Lookagram has become the second home for visual storytelling for everyone from celebrities, newsrooms and brands, to teens, musicians and anyone with a creative passion.</p>
<p>Prior to founding Lookagram, Dan was part of the startup of Gale Force Promotions, and still is. He was in construction his trade was metal stud framing and drywall residential and commercial in Alaska. He then moved to Aloha, OR as he became partners with the first peer to peer (P2P) Internet TV Network called AdultInternet.TV. Their company was about 6 years ahead of their time as high speeds of internet were not so available. They let the business dissolve. Dan went back into the construction field where he still works in to this day and works on his social networking empire after hours with various teams across the globe.</p>

<h2>Daniel Gale (Technical Lead, Founder)</h2>
<p><strong>Daniel Gale</strong> (@DanGale) is the technical lead and founder of Lookagram, a global community that shares more than 200 thousand photos and video every day. As the head of engineering, Dan focuses on building products that bring out the creativity in all of us.</p>

<p>A native of Anchorage, Alaska, he still works in the construction field trying to get out like most construction contractors do. He is an avid social networking guru as he has became a user of Myspace, Facebook, Instagram, Snap Chat along with various other social networking sites. Since then he has taken all the social networking sites and their ideas and decided to develop his own social networking empire.</p>

<p>He started off developing FriendsNme.com which has taken off pretty well with little to no advertising and has made several enhancements to it possibly making it as good if not better than Facebook. He began to get burned out so instead of taking a break he decided to start another project called Lookagram. Yes, he admits he kind of copied what Instagram had to offer only because millions of users are already used to the User Interface (UI) and ease of the use of the network.</p>


<p>Dan decided to make more improvements to Lookagram by allowing users to upgrade for a small amount of money to have the ability to add audio to the users pictures. He also added the ability for users to increase the amount of time a user can add video. As a free user you are allowed to record 15 seconds of video for free but you have the option to be able to record up to 3 minutes of video and add up to 5 minutes of audio to any picture the user adds to their news feed. The only reason he is charging for the audio and video upgrades is due to the amount of server space is required to store and back up such data. As phone cameras are getting better and better in picture quality. You will see that the prices are an annual price and are pretty cheap starting around 1.99 per year. He hopes that his improvements to his social networking sites will entice you to join and tell your family and friends about it. He hopes you enjoy your use of the sites and is very open to suggestions for improvements.</p>
